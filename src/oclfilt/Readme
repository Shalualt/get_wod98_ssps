-----------------------------------------------------------------------

'oclfilt' - Reads and filters binary data from NODC/OCL WOD98 dataset,
outputs in ascii column format.  Filter parameters include:
  bathy depth
  lat/lon boundaries
  month range
  year range
  number of points in profile
  whether to include error-flagged data
  skipping to specified station #
  list of data variables which must have good data
  weeding out bad lat,lon=0 stations

Output format is directly readable as input by 'sspcomp', which calculates
soundspeed values for the profiles and appends them to the ascii columns.

oclfilt is essentially a commandline interface wrapper for the function
'getOCLStationData()', which does the real work for one profile entry.
oclfilt takes the commandline params and loops over all the stations in
the data file, calling getOCLStationData() for each one and passing the
commandline params to it.  getOCLStationData is designed to be used on
its own as a function in other programs to read and filter WOD98 data.
See man files for more detail and examples.

To unzip & expand (requires GNU's gzip package):
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% cd <your oclfilt directory>                            
% gunzip -c oclfilt-1.8.tar.gz | tar tvf - | more       # note contents
% gunzip -c oclfilt-1.8.tar.gz | tar xf -               # expand

To compile:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
% make
(I used GNU make 3.77 and didn't test with other make programs, but I
think it's a general enough make script it'll probably make okay in others.

Issues/Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* The bathy-database option, which substitutes in values from a separate
  bathy database if the bathy value in the header is unreasonable, requires
  the GMT3.3 (Generic Mapping Tools) package to be installed.
  See http://imina.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt for that.

* The sigfig value in the data isn't used in oclfilt, for the following reason:
  According to the readme file for WOD98, for our use (just looking at depth,
  temp, salinity data), we don't need to worry about applying the separate
  sigfig value to each numerical value - the only times it's supposedly used
  in the data is to show trace values for chemical/bio measurements, and to
  flag negative data.
  According to the readme file, there aren't any times when the precision
  of the recorded value is greater than what should've been recorded (eg,
  electronic device outputting values only good to tenths of volts but the
  person recording wrote down all eight decimal digits seen on the voltmeter).
  However, someday it would probably be reasonable to add a double-check of
  the sigfig value against the data-value anyways, just to be prudent.
  In the meantime, I haven't seen any trouble without the check so far.
